#
# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the
# tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between
# any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#
#
#
# Example:
# Given a binary tree
#
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        / \
# ⁠       2   3
# ⁠      / \
# ⁠     4   5
#
#
#
# Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
#
#
# Note:
# The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
# between them.
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def maxPath(root):
            if root.left == None and root.right == None:
                return

        diameter = 0

#
# Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital
# letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could
# be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For
# each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.
#
# However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two
# same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different
# tasks or just be idle.
#
# You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish
# all the given tasks.
#
#
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
# Output: 8
# Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
# The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

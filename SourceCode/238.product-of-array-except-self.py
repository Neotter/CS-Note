# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, Â return an array output such
# that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
# nums[i].
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
#
#
# Constraint:Â It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or
# suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
#
# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
#
# Follow up:
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not
# count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        p = 1
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(0, n):
            res.append(p)
            p = p * nums[i]
        p = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = res[i] * p
            p = p * nums[i]
        return res
